# scissors
Repository for paper scissors rock game.

This project is a simple Python script that allows players to play Rock, Paper, Scissors in either Player vs. Computer or Computer vs. Computer mode. Each run generates a new game, with possible outcomes being: Player 1 (human or computer) wins, Tie, or Player 2 (computer) wins.

The winning conditions are defined in the determine_winner function. For extensibility, additional rules for the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock version can be incorporated by updating this function with new choice1 and choice2 combinations.
